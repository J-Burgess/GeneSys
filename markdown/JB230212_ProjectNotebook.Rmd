# JB230210 Initialization of project.
* Reference genome:
  + hg38 patch 14.
  + https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.40
* Download the hg38 reference VCF from dbSNP
  + https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/latest_release/VCF/GCF_000001405.40.gz
* Pre-requisites:
  + Bowtie2 index built from reference genome FASTA.

## Building bowtie2 index:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}

bowtie2-build /home/james/Desktop/Projects/GeneSys/External_Data/ncbi-genomes-2023-02-12/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna /home/james/Desktop/Projects/GeneSys/External_Data/Bt2_hg38_idx/JB230212_hg38_bt2

```


## Obtaining pathogenic variants:
* There are multiple databases that exist for cataloging pathogenic variants.
  + Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD): http://www.hgmd.org/
  + Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM): https://omim.org/
  + Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC): http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic
  + ClinVAR: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/
  
## Downloading ClinVAR pathogenic variants summary:
* Tab separated text file:
  + Contains many columns but rsID will be the one to match called variants with. 

## Annotating called variants with rsIDs:
* Downloaded the hg38 reference VCF from dbSNP FTP server.
  + Plan to use bcftools-annotate to annotate rsID of called variants. 
  + Can then simply merge on matching rsID.
